- Menu items are active and links to the different sections when clicked.
- On laptops and desktop the menu items are underlined when hovered.

- The home section is responsive and well adjusted to different screen sizes.

### Unfixed Bugs

- Tried to target desktops (1200px and larger) to adjust the signup form to be centered in the picture in this section, but did not succeed. When I changed values in the media query for this type of screens, the outcome was also seen on laptop (992px and larger). I eventually chose to keep the design working as I wished for laptop sizes.

### Validation

- HTML. No errors or warnings to show.
- CSS. No errors found. 1 Warning: Imported style sheets are not checked in direct input and file upload modes
