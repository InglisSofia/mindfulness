          <h3>What is mindfulness?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Mindfulness is a training method that has its origins in Buddhism.</li>
            <br>
            <li>By training the brain, you can learn to become more present in the
            here and now.</li>
            <br>
            <li>It can be used as a method to deal with different
            types of mental illness such as stress or anxiety.</li>
          </ul>
          
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Why is mindfulness good?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Mindfulness has been shown to have many benefits and is therefore
            used as a method in healthcare in several contexts.</li>
            <br>
            <li>It is used as a sub-method in the treatment of stress, fatigue syndrome, pain,
            anxiety and milder forms of depression.</li>
            <br>
            <li>It is also part of the
            skills taught in the treatment of EIPS, also knowns as Borderline.</li>
          </ul>

            <div>
          <h3>What happens in the brain during mindfulness?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>It has been seen that mindfulness exercises have shown
            increased activity and increased structure in certain areas of the
            brain.</li>
            <br>
            <li>This has been demonstrated in the amygdala, which are the
            areas that control our fear, and in the frontal lobes that control
            our abstract thinking, our concentration, problem solving and
            emotion regulation, as well as our decision-making.</li>
          </ul>

        <div>
          <h3>Treatment with mindfulness</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>It is common for people to suffer from mental illness at some point
            in their lives, but there is effective treatment available.</li>
            <br>
            <li>At our Mindfulness clinic we use cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as a
            treatment method. Mindfulness can be part of this treatment.</li>
            <br>
            <li>For example, if you have difficulty sleeping, stress problems, have
            lost the desire to do things you previously thought were fun or feel
            that it is difficult to cope with your everyday life or your
            relationships, you are always welcome to contact us.</li>
            <br>
            <li>When you seek help for mental disorders from our clinic, you will
            receive a professional assessment of your problems and a
            recommendation on how to proceed and what type of help is right for
            you.</li>
