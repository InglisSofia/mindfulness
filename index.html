        <h3>What is mindfulness?</h3>
        <p>
          Mindfulness is a training method that has its origins in Buddhism. By
          training the brain, you can learn to become more present in the here
          and now, which can be used as a method to deal with different types of
          mental illness such as stress or anxiety.

            <h3>Why is mindfulness good?</h3>
            <p>
              Mindfulness has been shown to have many benefits and is therefore
              used as a method in healthcare in several contexts. It is used as
              a sub-method in the treatment of stress, fatigue syndrome, pain,
              anxiety and milder forms of depression. It is also part of the
              skills taught in the treatment of EIPS, also knowns as Borderline.

            <h3>What happens in the brain during mindfulness?</h3>
            <p>
              Although there are still questions about how mindfulness affects
              the brain, it has been seen that mindfulness exercises have shown
              increased activity and increased structure in certain areas of the
              brain. This has been demonstrated in the amygdala, which are the
              areas that control our fear, and in the frontal lobes that control
              our abstract thinking, our concentration, problem solving and
              emotion regulation, as well as our decision-making.

            <h3>Treatment with mindfulness</h3>
            <p>
              It is common for people to suffer from mental illness at some
              point in their lives, but there is effective treatment available.
              At our Mindfulness clinic we use cognitive behavioral therapy
              (CBT) as a treatment method. Mindfulness can be part of this
              treatment.
              <br />
              <br />
              For example, if you have difficulty sleeping, stress problems,
              have lost the desire to do things you previously thought were fun
              or feel that it is difficult to cope with your everyday life or
              your relationships, you are always welcome to contact us.
              <br />
              <br />
              When you seek help for mental disorders from our clinic, you will
              receive a professional assessment of your problems and a
              recommendation on how to proceed and what type of help is right
              for you.
